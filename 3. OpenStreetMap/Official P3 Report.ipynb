    "In someways OSM reminds me of the Waze app, but it lacks a public community, it feels as if it isn't obvious what one should do to contribute without diving into the docs. OSM has many quirks(like the label \"only loony's would ride bikes here\" that can be found in this dataset) and they vary from city to city, so I'd be interested in expanding on the locality of the maps. By keeping a standard map that is cross referenced with other map technology (google maps/bing) and customised maps which users can add to for whatever the reason may be. A map for a pub run, a Mini Cooper's map that highlights all of the points in an city/area that contains windy turns or less stop lights. THese maps could add gamification by allowing users to setup goals such as the \"Liverpudlian Pub Run\". This is a bit like FourSquare but instead think custom maps that can be privatised and membership controlled in an open source way. Not unlike a forum. Imagine that the \"loony\" bike lanes becomes a map for those who love to do bmx, or paths for parkour. I think we have map technology that is much more accurate than OSM and if that is OSM's goal then I don't see a users needs being met better than Google/Bing. \n",
    "Go custom, localised, particular. Maps for friends, maps for family. Maps that tell the secrets of a city. Now that's exciting.   \n",

    "I'd also like to discuss some major issues that I could forsee with the advent of this technology.\n",

    "-Data Reliablity\n",
    "Because we would be using Google/Bing based API's we'd be also relying on Google/BIng as dependcies for the map itself. Data fetching in an async way has been one of the most common problems in web technology today, so we'd be placing ourselves at the centre of it. If we choose to set up webhook like updates and live update the map we run into problems with some people seeing an updated map and others seeing an older one. Because api requests are limited, limited in how many requests you can make and not 100% uptime, we would be subject to latency and availability issues. In the middle of updating a map we could stop getting data which would upend the data quality. We would have to build a system that has redundancy built in and the ability to roll back or refetch when we cannot finish an api or db transaction. This introduces another possible fault point that is unavoidable in developing this types of systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Data integrity\n",
    "No matter how we implement the system we are adding complexity to the system which means the database and it's transactions will have to be remodelled and ultimately it will change the way the data is used. By cross referencing Google/Bing maps technology, we have to consider how OSM will *weight* user generated content as opposed to external map sources. The data will become much more complex as it brings in data from it's existing user base (user contribution and bots) and extend it to api's which might require reshaping the data to fit OSM's. Since OSM is committed to user contributions then we might consider keeping user contributed data as the primary source of truth and updates from external technology could be approved by users of OSM. IF we assume external sources are more accurate than OSM's then we place a heavier weight on the external sources and the data model should reflect that. \n",

    "Customised Map\n",
    "- How might updates cascade? \n",
    "Upon introducing the customised map feature we would be adding in facades or building data layers on top of the foundational map that OSM provides. As the underlying map changes, the references within the customised maps must also change. Keeping customised maps up to date involves running into the same issues I've talked about above. Some potentially new issues are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customised maps will \n",
    "- introduce complexity to the user access system.\n",
    "- store duplicate data (map data or references)\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that if the 'foundational' OSM map is updated that it must cascade to the customised maps as well. FOr any given point on the foundational map, there are possibly 1000's of references to it within  the customised maps and they are absolutely dependent on these references so all of the customised maps \"become incomplete\" as they were made to include this reference. If this reference point is updated, all should be well. But if it is moved or deleted, the maps are at risk at being useless or at least losing the completeness they had when they were created. \n",

There was quite a few errors and the data required extensive cleaning, much more than what could be done here. But I guess this is the nature of open source street maps, that being said there are also beautiful particularities about the data such as bike lanes marked \"only looneys\" and other unique entires that seem to form and sometimes other support it, giving the data more reliability."
